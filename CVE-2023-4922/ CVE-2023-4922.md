The snippt code shows that there is a ``path`` parameter required then doing URL decode.

The rest of the lines just set some headers , Then use ``readfile`` function that file and writes it to the output buffer.

``readfile`` function without any limitation or filteration , So it's vulnerable to local file inclusion (LFI).

## Exploitation 

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability due to ``path`` parameter via inject LFI paths such as ``download-file.php?path=/etc/hosts``.


## Mitigation

* Use filteration for the allowed files.
* Use random IDs for the needed files .
* Disable ``Allow_url_include`` because that cause SSRF too.
* Implementing Access Controls and Restrict Access.
